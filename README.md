# Recommendation-system-in-medicine

This project is devoted to the applicability of multivalued logic for making understandable decisions in expert systems and organizing feedback. Medicine was chosen as the subject area. The developed application provides constant intellectual support to the doctor with an explanation of the decisions taken when determining the area of the specialist to whom the patient should contact based on his symptoms. The application also supports the adjustment of the knowledge base, taking into account the data entered by the doctor and the fi-nal diagnosis of the patient, and the qualification and expertise of the doctor are taken into account during the adjustment. The prototype supports chang-ing and adding new data, which makes it very flexible. The knowledge base of the created system consists of production rules that are easily readable for any person, because they are written in the form of "if ... then" consequences. In addition, the prototype is written in the cross-platform and well-known py-thon programming language, which greatly facilitates the search for a devel-opment specialist.

A prototype of a cross-platform desktop application that demonstrates the possibilities of using multivalued logic to develop feedback artificial intelligence systems.  This prototype can be used as a basis for creating intelligent systems in various fields of medicine.
